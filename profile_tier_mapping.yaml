# Mapping between legacy permission profiles and v2 capability tiers
# This enables backward compatibility while transitioning to the tier system

# Direct mappings

  restricted: "observer"        # Read-only access
  standard: "communicator"      # Basic agent capabilities
  trusted: "executor"           # Can execute tasks and DSL
  researcher: "coordinator"     # Can spawn and coordinate agents
  
# Reverse mappings for profile inference

  communicator: "standard"

  coordinator: "researcher"
  orchestrator: "researcher"     # Advanced researcher capabilities
  administrator: "researcher"   # System admin still maps to researcher profile

    description: "Minimal read-only access for observation"
    equivalent_tier: "observer"
    rationale: "Maps to observer tier for read-only system observation"
    
  standard:
    description: "Standard agent with communication capabilities"
    equivalent_tier: "communicator"
    rationale: "Maps to communicator for basic messaging and state tracking"
    
  trusted:
    description: "Trusted agent that can execute tasks and workflows"
    equivalent_tier: "executor"
    rationale: "Maps to executor for DSL execution and task performance"
    
  researcher:
    description: "Advanced agent with spawning and coordination capabilities"
    equivalent_tier: "coordinator"
    rationale: "Maps to coordinator for multi-agent orchestration"
